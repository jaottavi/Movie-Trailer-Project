**Author**: James Ottavi

**Date Created**: February 19th, 2017

## Summary
These python programs output a local web browser page that shows a series
of movie posters, and once clicked on, those specific movies youtube trailers.

## Files
- `movie.py`
  - This program sets up the class `Movie` and it's related instance variables and
  methods
- `entertainment.py`
  - This program initializes all of the movies that will be used to create the
  movie webpage in addition to producing the final webpage. The movies include:
    - *Logan*
    - *Guardians of the Galaxy II*
    - *The Imitation Game*
    - *Ironman*
    - *Hidden Figure*
- `fresh_tomatoes.py`
  - This program utilizes both HTML, CSS, JS, and Python languages to give
  structure to the final webpage. It uses the list of movie objects from the
  `entertainment.py` program. This code was created by *Udacity*.

## Steps to Run Programs
1. Download all of the necessary files as listed above into a single repository.
2. Make sure that you have Python downloaded on your computer. If not, you can
download the necessary files [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
[**Note**: Make sure to download version **2.7.13** as that is the version that these
files run on.]
3. Once Python is installed, you should open up the `entertainment.py` program
either within Idle (the pre-installed compiler for Python) or another editor
that can run python scripts.
4. Run the program, and have fun watching all of the movie trailers!
